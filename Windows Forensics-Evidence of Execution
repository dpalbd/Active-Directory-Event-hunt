Link Files
Windows uses the folder C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Recent to store LNK files associated with files a user has recently accessed, typically by 
double-clicking on it in a Windows Explorer window.

If the file is reopened, it will be overwritten with the latest file access regardless of whether the file exists in a different directory.
For check LNK files
C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Recent

Jump Lists
Jump Lists are files that are generated on a per-user basis for two purposes. AutomaticDestinations are auto-populated when an application associated with a file is run and
stored in a subfolder within the Recent folder.
When viewing either of these folders, the files associated with each application are designated with a postfix of “-ms” and an AppID. 
The AppID meaning requires  web searching.
Jump Lists files themselves contain valuable information, including the last time the associated application was run and what files/LNKs were opened.

Prefetch and Superfetch

To improve application loading speed, Windows introduced Prefetch in Windows XP. Prefetch essentially grabs all of the files associated with an application from disk and 
writes them to memory so the user doesn’t have to wait for them to be loaded from disk.
The Prefetch folder (C:\Windows\Prefetch) that allows these actions to take place contains files where each application is tracked in a correspondingly named.PF file and 
a hash of the executable.
In modern Windows systems, each file contains a path to the executable, the most recent and previous seven times the executable was run, and files/directories used by the executable.

It should also be noted that Prefetch is not always enabled, particularly when the system is running on SSDs rather than spinning disk. 
This can be checked by examining the HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Memory Management\PrefetchParameters registry key. 
If subkeys EnablePrefetcher and EnableSuperfetch show a value of 0, the function is not enabled.

System Resource Usage Monitor (SRUM)
Task Manager is just a small subset of data stored in the System Resource Monitor(SRUM) database, introduced in Windows 8 for tracking resource use. 
The full database is located at C:\Windows\system32\sru\SRUDB.dat.
While running, Windows temporarily stores this data in the HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrenVersion\SRUM\Extensions and writes to SRUDB.dat at shutdown.
SRUM contains a wealth of information about user activity including the full path to executables, CPU time in the foreground and background, and the SID responsible for execution.

Registry Hives
The Windows Registry is a collection of hierarchical databases that contains information, settings, options, and other values leveraged by the Windows operating system and applications that make use of it. There’s a ton of information to help provide evidence of execution if one knows where to look for it.

HKCU\<User SID>\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\
Explorer\
RecentDocs – Stores several keys that can be used to determine what files were accessed by an account. The MRUListEx key shows the order in which files were accessed.
TypedPaths – Shows items typed into the Windows Explorer bar by the user.
UserAssist – ROT-13 encoded names of GUI programs that have been run and the number of times each has run.

HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Shell – Often referred to as Shellbags, this registry location (NTUSER.DAT) and the following one (UsrClass.dat) record whenever a user accesses 
a folder or zip file. 

HKCU\SOFTWARE\Classes – Stored at C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\UsrClass.dat. This Registry Hive was added in Windows 7 to segment a section of the Registry for
lower permission processes that can’t (and shouldn’t) write to more restrictive hives.

HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\
Run\ – This location is used to execute programs at user logon and is a favorite for attackers who are looking to retain persistence on a system. 

RunOnce\ – Similar to “Run”, RunOnce is used to execute an application on the next login and is purged afterward. Also a favorite of bad actors to retain persistence, 
but also used legitimately for things like software installations or updates that require clean up processes after forcing a reboot.

dam\UserSettings – dam is the Desktop Activity Monitor) and stores similar information to bam.
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SRUM\Extensions – See the section on System Resource Usage Monitor (SRUM)for details.
